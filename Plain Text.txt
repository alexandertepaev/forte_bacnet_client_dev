09.11:
  + Moved insertion/deletion to/form invokeid-handle diction to the controller
  + Refactored send routine in controller's runLoop() - removed not needed copy of destenation address
  + Decoding BVLC function (should be renamed): removed support of segmented messages - for now only unsegmented complex acks are supported
  + Can now decode received application data (in ReadPropertyHandle). Can only get tag of the received data (Real), but cannot access value.Real.
